Hi, I'm Taras!
I'm a software engineer with a passion for building innovative solutions to complex problems. I hold a degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley, and have worked in a variety of roles at tech companies ranging from startups to large corporations.

My expertise includes programming languages such as Java, Python, and Ruby, as well as popular frameworks such as React and Angular. I have experience working with databases and cloud services such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.

Some of my notable projects include a mobile app that uses machine learning to help users learn a new language, a web-based dashboard for managing social media campaigns, and a chatbot that can answer common customer service questions.

In my free time, I enjoy attending hackathons and contributing to open source projects. I'm particularly interested in using technology to make a positive impact on society, whether that's through environmental sustainability, social justice, or education.
